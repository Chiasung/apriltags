COMPILATION:

To get this to compile, you should only need to change CMakeLists.txt.
Look for the string "CHANGE THIS:" for a short description of what to do.

RUNNING:

By default this subscribes to the /Image topic.
Then you can run the node using:

rosrun apriltags apriltags

Nothing will happen until something subscribes to the output topic which is:

/apriltags/marker_array

If you use rostopic hz on /apriltags/marker_array it will subscribe and cause
node to start updating.

If you want to visualize the results, you can set a param before starting the 
node:

rosparam set /apriltags/viewer 1

(The viewer should highlite the detected tags).
